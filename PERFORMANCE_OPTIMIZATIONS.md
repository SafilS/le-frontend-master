# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to improve the website's performance score.

## Component Optimizations

### 1. Memoization
- Used `React.memo()` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components
- Implemented `useMemo()` for expensive calculations and object creation
- Applied `useCallback()` for event handlers and functions passed to child components

### 2. Code Splitting
- Created smaller, focused components
- Reduced component complexity
- Implemented proper component hierarchy

### 3. Lazy Loading
- Created a `LazyImage` component for optimized image loading
- Implemented blur-up loading effect for images
- Used IntersectionObserver for better lazy loading

### 4. Animation Optimizations
- Reduced number of animated elements
- Simplified animation effects
- Used hardware-accelerated properties for animations
- Reduced animation complexity in mobile views

## Context Optimizations

### 1. HeroImageContext
- Implemented proper caching strategy
- Added image preloading
- Used AbortController for fetch requests
- Memoized context values to prevent unnecessary re-renders

## Build Optimizations

### 1. Vite Configuration
- Configured proper chunk splitting
- Enabled terser minification
- Removed console logs in production
- Optimized asset handling
- Improved CSS processing

### 2. HTML Optimizations
- Added preload directives for critical resources
- Implemented critical CSS inline
- Added loading spinner for initial page load
- Improved meta tags for better SEO

## Image Optimizations

### 1. Image Loading
- Created utility functions for image optimization
- Implemented responsive images with srcSet
- Added proper loading attributes (eager/lazy)
- Used fetchpriority attribute for critical images

### 2. Image Format
- Added support detection for modern image formats
- Implemented placeholder images for better perceived performance

## Animation Optimizations

### 1. Framer Motion
- Memoized animation variants
- Reduced number of animated elements
- Used simpler animations for better performance
- Implemented proper exit animations

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. Implement server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG)
2. Add service worker for offline support and caching
3. Implement HTTP/2 server push for critical resources
4. Use WebP images for better compression
5. Implement proper code splitting with React.lazy() and Suspense
6. Add proper error boundaries for better error handling
7. Implement proper analytics with minimal performance impact
8. Use Web Workers for CPU-intensive tasks
9. Implement proper font loading strategy
10. Add proper cache headers for static assets

## Performance Monitoring

To monitor the performance of the website, consider using:

1. Google Lighthouse
2. WebPageTest
3. Chrome DevTools Performance panel
4. React DevTools Profiler
5. Google Analytics performance events
